<h1>Features</h1>
This is my professional website/portfolio that lists a few of my large projects as well as gives a little background 
into who I am, and my journey in tech so far. I have disabled the Contact section to prevent unwanted solicitation.
The technologies used to make the site were React, Node, NextJs, JavaScript, and CSS. 

The site is fully responsive on most devices.

About
This application was made to work on my NextJs skills and to recreate a better, more modern-looking portfolio.
